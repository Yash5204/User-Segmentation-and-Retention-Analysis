# 📊 User Segmentation and Retention Analysis

This project focuses on identifying user churn patterns and segmenting users based on behavioral data to improve retention and product engagement. Built using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

---

## 📌 Objective

To analyze user activity data through cohort analysis and RFM segmentation, uncover early-stage churn risks, and visualize actionable retention insights through interactive dashboards.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Simulated or anonymized user event dataset  
- Fields include: `user_id`, `signup_date`, `last_active_date`, `event_type`, `frequency`, `monetary_value`, `platform`, `region`, etc.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn)** – Cohort table generation, RFM scoring, churn detection  
- **SQL** – Querying behavioral and transactional data for aggregation and cohort grouping  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation, user segmentation visualization, retention heatmaps
  

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

- 🧠 **RFM Segmentation** – Grouped users into High, Medium, and Low value segments  
- 📅 **Cohort Analysis** – Tracked Day 1, Day 7, Day 30 retention rates  
- ⚠️ **Churn Drop-off Detection** – Uncovered major drop-off (~35%) by Day 7 for new users  
- 📈 **Retention Heatmaps** – Visualized cohort activity trends in Power BI  
- 📤 **Strategic Recommendations** – Proposed onboarding flow and notification changes to increase user stickiness

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Only 65% of users remained active beyond Day 7, suggesting onboarding needs improvement  
- RFM segments revealed top 20% of users contributed over 50% of revenue  
- Users engaging within first 3 days had 2.5x higher Week 4 retention  
- Suggested early nudges and targeted content to extend Day 1 engagement

## 📸 Dashboard Highlights

>  
- Retention heatmap by cohort  
- RFM score distribution by user group  
- Drop-off funnel from signup to Day 30 activity

---

## 🏁 Outcome

The project helped simulate a real-world product analytics scenario and produced:
- A complete cohort-based retention dashboard  
- Segment-specific user strategies to reduce churn  
- Recommendations to improve onboarding and lifecycle engagement
